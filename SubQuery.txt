SubQuery = Query within query = nested query

DQL = 
Select * from worker where department='HR';

Select * from worker where salary>100000;




Select salary from worker where first_name='abc';
120000
Select * from worker where salary>120000;

subquery eg.
Select * from worker where salary>(Select salary from worker where first_name='abc');

Point to remember
1.Reverse Execution (i.e. first query will execute last and last query execute first.)

2.You can nest any number of query.

3.You can address different table in each query.


eg.

Select empname from employee where empheadid=(
Select empid from employees where empname='abhishek');



Select deptname from empdept where deptid in (Select department from employee where empid>103);
